ArtChain Ukraine

ArtChain Ukraine offers a new economic model where NFTs gain real liquidity, similar to BTC or ETH. Experts (curators and artists) evaluate each NFT to set a fair initial price, while a liquidity pool guarantees buyback at any time. Popular works attract investments, increasing their value.

We integrate DAO for community governance, DeFi for financial mechanisms, and an NFT marketplace to build a transparent, fair, and secure ecosystem. Built on Optimism with an open-source approach, the platform supports Ukrainian artists, giving them a global stage in Web3.

Goal: Empower Ukrainian artists and protect investors through innovative technology.

Budget: $151,000 (MVP $66,000, Liquidity $25,000, Security $30,000, Marketing $30,000).
